# 💈 Online Salon ✂️

🚀 This project leverages **OpenCV** and **computer vision** techniques to apply virtual hair filters in real time, providing a fun and interactive experience. 💇‍♂️😎

---

## 🎯 Overview
The system detects faces using **Haar Cascade Classifier** and overlays a selection of virtual hairstyles onto the user's image. Users can experiment with different hairstyles in real time, offering a novel approach to virtual hair styling.

---

## 🛋️ Project Workflow 📌
1. **Face Detection** 👀: Uses Haar Cascade to detect faces in real-time.
2. **Hair Overlay** 💅: Selects and applies a predefined hair filter onto the detected face.
3. **Interactive Styling** 👗: Users can change hairstyles dynamically.
